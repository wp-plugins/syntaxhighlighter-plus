== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The BBCode in my post is being replaced with &lt;pre&gt;'s just fine, but I don't see the syntax highlighting! =

Make sure your theme's footer has `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` somewhere in it, otherwise the JavaScript highlighting files won't be loaded.

= I still see the BBCode in my post. What gives? =

Make sure you correctly use the BBCode with a valid language attribute. A malformed usage of it won't result in replacement.

== Screenshots ==
