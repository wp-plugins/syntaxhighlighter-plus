* Ruby -- `rb`, `ruby`, `rails`, `ror`
* SQL -- `sql`
* VB -- `vb`, `vb.net`
* XML/HTML -- `xml`, `html`, `xhtml`, `xslt`

This plugin uses the [SyntaxHighlighter JavaScript package by Alex Gorbatchev](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/).

== Installation ==

###Updgrading From A Previous Version###

To upgrade from a previous version of this plugin, delete the entire folder and files from the previous version of the plugin and then follow the installation instructions below.

* Starting from Wordpress 2.7, plugin upgrades are handled by Wordpress, there is no need to manually upload files.

Important: If you have made any changes to the CSS file, please make sure to back it up before upgrade!

###Uploading The Plugin###

Extract all files from the ZIP file, making sure to keep the file structure intact, and then upload it to `/wp-content/plugins/`.

This should result in the following file structure:

`- wp-content
    - plugins
        - syntaxhighlighter-plus
            | readme.txt
            | syntaxhighlighter.php
            - syntaxhighlighter
                - scripts

	                | shLegacy.js
                - src
                    | shCore.js
	                | shLegacy.js

###Plugin Activation###

Go to the admin area of your WordPress install and click on the "Plugins" menu. Click on "Activate" for the "SyntaxHighlighter" plugin.

###Plugin Usage###

Just wrap your code in `[sourcecode language='css']code here[/sourcecode]`. The language attribute is **required**! See the [plugin's description](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) for a list of valid language attributes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The BBCode in my post is being replaced with &lt;pre&gt;'s just fine, but I don't see the syntax highlighting! =

Make sure your theme's footer has `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` somewhere in it, otherwise the JavaScript highlighting files won't be loaded.

= I still see the BBCode in my post. What gives? =

Make sure you correctly use the BBCode with a valid language attribute. A malformed usage of it won't result in replacement.

= I use the visual editor, my code has lots of line breaks inserted, what do I do? =

Use 'shift + return' instead of 'return' when changing lines.

== Other BBCode Methods ==

Find `[sourcecode language='css']code here[/sourcecode]` too long to type? Here's some alternative examples:

* `[source language='css']code here[/source]`
* `[code language='css']code here[/code]`
* `[sourcecode lang='css']code here[/sourcecode]`
* `[source lang='css']code here[/source]`
* `[code lang='css']code here[/code]`
* `[sourcecode='css']code here[/sourcecode]`
* `[source='css']code here[/source]`
* `[code='css']code here[/code]`
* `[lang='css']code here[/lang]`
* `[css]code here[/css]` (or any of the supported language)

Note: Quotation marks around the language can be omitted for even shorter and neater syntax. :-)
